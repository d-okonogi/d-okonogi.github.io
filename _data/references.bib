  abstract = {Combinatorial optimization (CO) is vital for making wiser decisions and planning in our society. Annealing computation is a promising CO approach derived from an analogy to physical phenomena (Fig. 2.3.1). It represents a CO problem as an energy function, a quadratic form of 1, -1 vectors, where each binary element is called a (pseudo) spin. The spin vector is initialized randomly and is updated stochastically to find minimum energy states by gradually reducing the (pseudo) temperature. Local-connection annealers (quantum [1] and non-quantum [2-4]) have been constrained to spin models having only local inter-spin couplings. This restriction, however, severely limits their CO applications even with the help of clever graph embedding algorithms. Full-connection annealers [5], [6], considered here, have been proposed to address this drawback, permitting handling of arbitrary topologies and densities of inter-spin couplings, even if they are irregular.},

  abstract = {Annealing computation has recently attracted attention as it can efficiently solve various combinatorial optimization problems using an Ising model. Stochastic cellular automata annealing (SCA) is a promising algorithm that can realize fast spin-update by utilizing its parallel computing capability. However, in SCA, preparing an appropriate control of the pinning parameter is a hard task, which degrades its usability. This paper proposes a novel approach called APC-SCA (Autonomous Pinning effect Control SCA) where the spin pinning parameter can be controlled autonomously by observing individual spin flips. The evaluation results using max-cut and N-queen problems demonstrate that the proposed approach can obtain better solutions than the conventional approach with a grid search of optimal pinning parameter control.},
